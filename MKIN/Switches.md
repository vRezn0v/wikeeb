Switches are the core components of mechanical keyboards that register key presses. Each switch sits beneath a keycap and determines how a key feels, sounds, and responds when pressed. 
Switches vary in actuation force (how much pressure is needed to register a keypress) and travel distance, giving users the ability to choose a switch that best suits their typing or gaming preferences.
