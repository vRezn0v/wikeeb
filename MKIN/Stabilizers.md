Stabilizers are used to prevent larger keys (like the spacebar, shift, enter, and backspace) from wobbling or tilting when pressed. Without stabilizers, these keys might feel unstable or unbalanced, leading to a less satisfying sound and typing experience. They work by evenly distributing pressure across the keycap, ensuring smooth and consistent keypresses. There are different types of stabilizers, such as [[Clip-in]], [[Screw-in]], and [[Plate-mounted]], and they can be modified or lubricated to improve feel and reduce noise.
