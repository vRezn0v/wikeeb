A **keyboard PCB (Printed Circuit Board)** is the backbone of any mechanical keyboard, serving as the main board that connects all the switches and components. It’s where each switch is soldered or connected, and it registers key presses by sending signals to the keyboard’s controller. PCBs come in different layouts to support various keyboard sizes and layouts (e.g., full-size, TKL, 60%, HHKB).

There are two main types of PCBs:

- **[[Soldered PCB]]s** require switches to be soldered onto the board, making them more permanent but typically more durable.
- **[[Hot-swappable PCB]]s** allow switches to be inserted and removed without soldering, making it easier to change or replace switches.

PCBs can also support features like [[**RGB lighting]]**, programmable layouts, layering, and **[[QMK/VIA]]** firmware for advanced customization. The PCB's quality impacts the keyboard’s performance, longevity, and ability to support certain customizations, making it a critical component for mechanical keyboards.
