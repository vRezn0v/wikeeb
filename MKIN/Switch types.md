Mechanical switches come in three main types: **linear**, **tactile**, and **clicky**.

- **[[Linear switches]]** provide a smooth keystroke with no tactile feedback or click,
- **[[Tactile switches]]** offer a noticeable bump when activated but are quieter,
- **[[Clicky switches]]** have both a tactile bump and an audible click.

In addition to traditional mechanical switches, there are also **Topre** and **Hall-effect** switches, which offer different typing experiences:

- [[Topre switches]] are a unique hybrid between mechanical and rubber dome switches. They use a rubber dome for cushioning but incorporate a spring beneath it, providing a smooth, tactile feel with a slight "[[thock]]" sound. These switches are often praised for their comfort and are known for being quiet and durable. They are commonly found in high-end keyboards like those made by [[Realforce]] or [[HHKB]].
- **[[Hall effect switches]]** are a type of mechanical switch that use magnets and sensors to detect key presses, rather than physical contact like traditional mechanical switches. In these switches, a small magnet is placed on the key stem, and a Hall effect sensor detects the movement of the magnet when a key is pressed. This technology allows for extremely smooth key presses, long durability (since there's no physical contact to wear down), and precise actuation. They are also sometimes adjustable, allowing users to fine-tune the actuation point of each key for a more personalized typing experience.
