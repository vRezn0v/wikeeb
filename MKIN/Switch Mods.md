There are several popular modifications that can be done on keyboard switches to improve their sound, feel, and overall performance. Here are some common mods:
1. **[[Lubing switches]]**: Applying lubricant to the internal parts of a switch (stem, spring, and housing) reduces friction and creates smoother keystrokes. Lubing also minimizes scratchiness and can lower noise, especially in linear and tactile switches..
    
2. **[[Spring swapping]]**: Replacing the stock springs inside switches with ones of different weights can change how much force is required to press a key. This is known as **spring swapping** or **spring modding**. It allows users to adjust the actuation force to suit their typing or gaming preferences.
    
3. **[[Filming switches]]**: **Switch films** are thin pieces of material inserted between the top and bottom housings of a switch. They help stabilize the switch housing, reducing wobble and tightening the overall feel. This can lead to a cleaner, crisper sound and more consistent key presses.
    
    
4. **[[Switch Break-in]]**: The **break-in mod** is a process where keyboard switches are repeatedly pressed to speed up their natural wear and tear, making them smoother over time. When switches are brand new, they can feel scratchy or stiff due to minor imperfections in the plastic components. The break-in process gradually polishes these internal surfaces through repeated use.
