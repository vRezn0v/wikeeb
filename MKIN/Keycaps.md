Keycaps are simply the removable covers on top of mechanical keyboard switches, providing the surface you press while typing. They come in various shapes, sizes, colors, and materials, allowing for customization and a personalized typing experience. Common materials for keycaps include ABS and PBT, with PBT being more durable and resistant to wear, there are some more novelty materials available in the market like Ceramic and Metal. Keycaps also feature different profiles, like Cherry, OEM, and SA, which determine their height and shape. Swapping keycaps is an easy way to enhance the look, feel, and sound of your keyboard.
